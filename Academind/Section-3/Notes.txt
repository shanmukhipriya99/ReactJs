1) To install: npm i create-react-app -g
2) To create structure, go to the path: create-react-app name_of_the_app
3) To follow a specific structure:      create-react-app name_of_the_app --scripts-version 1.1.5
4) In react, there's html like code in the .js file, but it is JSX and not HTML
5) A component is a function returning some JSX
6) { Component } should be imported only if any class is being extended
7) In the JSX, the lowercase tags are the native tags and so the ones created by us should begin with upper-case
8) Components can be created in two ways:
	Functional or presentational or dumb or stateless components: doesn't extend to Component
	Class-based or containers or smart or stateful components: extends to Component
9) (props) looks like a single parameter but it's like an object that contains all the parameters passed, when called
10) state is used to change the component and can only be used with class-based components11) react hooks is basically a collection of functions exposed to you by react which can be used in functional components
12) useState() is one of the functions provided by hooks and can be used only for functional components. It returns exactly 2 elements in an array
	first element: current state and updated state, whenever changed
	second element: always a function that allows us to update this state
13) Js allows to have a function definition inside another function: can be used with hooks
14) A stateful component is a component that manages state, no matter if it's using the useState hook or a class-based approach with the state property
15) A component like the person.js file, this person component is a stateless component because it has no internal state management
16) You can pass methods as props so that you can call a method which might change the state in another component/file which doesn't have direct access to the state
