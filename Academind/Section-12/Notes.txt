1) Components loaded through <Router /> have access to props with history, location, and match 
2) The child components of the parent will not have access to these special props
3) There is a special higher order component named withRouter that allows us to pass these special props
4) We need to import withRouter from react-router-dom and also wrap the export statement with it
5) history is one of these special props provided by the router and there we have this push prop which allows us 
   to basically switch the page and push a new page onto that stack of pages
   this.props.history.push('/..')
6) this.props.history.goBack()
   this.props.history.replace()
   this.props.histroy.push()
7) encodeURIComponent() -> encodes elements such that they can be used in the URL (removes whitespace, etc) 
8) URLSearchParams(this.props.location.search) ---???
9) query.entries() ---???
10)
