npm i --save red
1. Redux is a 3rd-party library which works totally indepenent of React.
2. Central Store: stores the entire application state.
3. Uses the node.js syntax when not linked to react.
4. Reducer is a pure function.
5. Mulitple reducers will be combined into a single reducer.
6. Reducer needs to be created before the store as it is passed as an argument to the store.
7. Reducer receives the state (old state) and the action. It returns the updated state.
8. The dispatch function can contain any parameters with any name, but the first one always has to be "type".
9. Never mutate the state directly, always create a copy of it (prefereably with the spread operator) and 
   work on the new copy.
10. To subscribe, a subscribe function is used which takes one parameter. A function that gets executed whenever the 
    the state is updated (This function doesn't get any arguments).
11. Subscription should be set up after the store is created.
12. npm i --save react-redux: for connecting store to react.
13. Wrap the <App /> component with <Provider>. Provider is a helper component which allows us to kind of inject our 
    store into the react components.
14. npm update react react-dom
15. npm install --save react-redux@5.1.2
