1) A functional component that manages its own state with the help of useState would also be considered a stateful component
2) Therefore, stateful doesn't automatically mean class-based component
3) Presentational component is a functional component that does not manage state
4) useEffect is the second most important react hook. It's more like a function that can be added into a functio component
5) useEffect combines componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate
6) React doesn't allow rendering more than one JSX element i.e it can have a single parent element with any number of children
7) The way around this is to use return []; instead of return(); and separate the elements with ','
    In this way, we will be returning an array of elements and this is allowed as it is a single parent element, ultimately
    But each of these elements must have a key property (can be done manually)
8) Another way is to use Auxiliary.js with props.children (much easier)
9) After creating Auxiliary.js, <Aux></Aux> can also be replaced with <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> or <Fragment></Fragment> if Fragment is imported from react
